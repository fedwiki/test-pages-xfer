# example transfer of ownership of github pages

We intend to transfer a plugin repo from to a github organization.

There are files in that repo published as github pages which are used in pages out in the wider federation.
We have learned that the transfer of a repo breaks the links to those published github pages.

With this repo we are testing how to repair the links for the pages in the wider federation.
